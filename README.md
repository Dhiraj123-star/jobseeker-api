# 🔍 JobSeeker API

**JobSeeker API** is a lightweight backend project designed to manage and search job listings. Built with **FastAPI** for high-performance API development and **Elasticsearch** for robust full-text search, the project is fully containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose** for seamless deployment.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### ✅ Add Job Listings
- Enables users or administrators to add job postings to the system.
- Each job includes fields like `title`, `company name`, `description`, `tags` (skills/technologies), and `location`.
- Jobs are indexed in Elasticsearch for optimized search performance.

### 🔍 Search Job Listings
- Offers a search endpoint to query job listings using keywords.
- Supports full-text search across fields such as `title`, `description`, `tags`, `company`, and `location`.
- Delivers fast and relevant job search results powered by Elasticsearch's advanced search capabilities.

## ⚙️ Technical Overview

- **FastAPI**: Handles API endpoints, request validation, and response formatting with high performance.
- **Elasticsearch**: Acts as the storage and search engine for job data, enabling efficient full-text queries.
- **Docker**: Ensures the application is isolated and reproducible across environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Simplifies multi-container setup for FastAPI and Elasticsearch.

## 📦 Project Highlights

- Lightweight and modular design for easy customization and extension.
- Clean architecture separating application logic, data models, and Elasticsearch integration.
- Automatic index creation on startup for hassle-free setup.
- Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI (auto-generated by FastAPI).
- Fully containerized for consistent local development and deployment.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images to Docker Hub.

## 🛠️ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automate building and deploying Docker images. On every push to the `main` branch, the workflow:

1. **Checks out code**: Clones the repository to the runner.
2. **Sets up Docker Buildx**: Configures Buildx for multi-platform image builds.
3. **Logs in to Docker Hub**: Authenticates using stored secrets.
4. **Extracts commit message**: Uses the latest commit message to create a unique image tag.
✅ Images are available on Docker Hub, ensuring the latest application version is ready for deployment.
